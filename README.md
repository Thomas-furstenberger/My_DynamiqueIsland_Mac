# My_DynamiqueIsland_Mac
This is a Dynamic Island for Mac that I developed myself. This project was my first project made with SwiftUI, and I used Xcode to build it. I designed this application to bring a similar experience to the iPhone’s Dynamic Island on macOS, leveraging SwiftUI’s capabilities for a smooth and responsive interface.
