Dynamic Island for Mac



🚀 Introduction

This is a Dynamic Island for Mac that I developed myself. This project was my first experience with SwiftUI, and I used Xcode to build it. The goal was to bring a similar experience to the iPhone’s Dynamic Island onto macOS, leveraging SwiftUI’s capabilities to create a smooth and responsive interface.
