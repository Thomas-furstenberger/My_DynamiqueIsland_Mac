# Dynamic Island for Mac

## 🚀 Introduction  
This is a **Dynamic Island for Mac** that I developed myself. This project was my first experience with **SwiftUI**, and I used **Xcode** to build it. The goal was to bring a similar experience to the iPhone’s **Dynamic Island** onto **macOS**, leveraging SwiftUI’s capabilities to create a smooth and responsive interface.

## 🎯 Features  
- **Mac Adaptation** 🖥️: Brings the iPhone’s **Dynamic Island** concept to macOS.  
- **Smooth Animations** ✨: Uses **SwiftUI** to ensure fluid transitions.  
- **Customizable Experience** ⚙️: Allows modifications to suit user preferences.  
- **Lightweight & Efficient** ⚡: Designed with performance in mind.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **SwiftUI** 🍏: For building the UI.  
- **Xcode** 🏗️: The main development environment.  
- **macOS Frameworks** 🖥️: For seamless system integration.
